# Minishell

Welcome to Minishell! This is a C project that aims to create a simple shell program, providing a command-line interface where users can execute commands and manage processes.

## Features

- Command execution: Execute commands entered by the user, including built-in commands and external programs.
- Built-in commands: Support for common shell built-in commands such as `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and `exit`.
- Input/output redirection: Allow input/output redirection using `<` and `>` operators.
- Pipeline and command chaining: Enable the execution of commands in a pipeline or chain using `|` and `;` operators.
- Environment variables: Support for managing environment variables, including setting, getting, and exporting variables.
- Signal handling: Proper handling of signals, including Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP).
- Job control: Basic job control features, including background execution and managing background/foreground processes.

## Getting Started

To compile and run Minishell on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the `readline` library:
4. Compile the code using a C compiler and link with the `readline` library:
5. Run the Minishell program:
6. You can now start entering commands and interacting with the shell.

## Usage

Minishell supports the following built-in commands:

- `cd <directory>`: Change the current working directory.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `echo <message>`: Print the specified message.
- `exit`: Exit the shell program.

Additional shell features such as input/output redirection, pipeline execution, environment variable management, and job control can be used as part of the command line.
